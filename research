# Measuring efficiency of Peruvian universities: a stochastic frontier analysis
[Link](https://e-archivo.uc3m.es/handle/10016/36250)
 **Abstract:** In comparison with other regions such as Europe or the USA, there have been relatively few studies of efficiency in the higher education sector in South America. The main objective of this paper is to examine the teaching efficiency of Peruvian, public universities over the period 2011-2018, usingstochastic frontier analysis. Our results suggest that efficiency depends on both the operating time of the university and on the scientific production. We also show that the majority of universities studied maintain their efficiency levels over time, whereas, most of the young universities started off as very inefficient, but have improved their efficiency over time
